What I didn't expect was for the hike to be a 5 hour slog through the jungle and for it to be 31°, I also took the smart decision to take a “shortcut” based on a comment left on a message board, which took me off the path and down a steep narrow gulley I affectionately named Spider Alley, only for the path to become a river thanks to all the rain over the past few days. That of course meant I had to hike back up The Alley, so lesson learned there. \n To be honest it was worth it in the end for the views, the waterfalls and the completely deserted beach surrounded by two rivers as they reached the sea. So if you're ever on Ilha Grande I'd recommend the Dois Rios hike, but maybe wear something other than white trainers unless you want them painted brown. After hiking the 12km back to Abrãao, I rewarded myself with a massive steak on the beach at a restaurant as inventively named as the island itself: Steak & Beach."

The area around town seems to have parts of Nevada, Utah, California, Northern Scotland, New Zeland and of course Switzerland all stitched together. Continued below...",

Once we got to San Martin the clouds parted for a while so we had time to do a little hike on the cliffs surrounding the town/lake and then we found a lovely little restaurant for some fresh smoked lake trout sorrentinos. I'm currently writing this on a 6 hour bus through the Andes to Puerto Montt in Chile so I can fly further south into the heart of Patagonia to hike some pointy mountains (and yes it's one of the most beautiful bus rides I've ever taken)."

A few of us got a bus to do a ~3 hour walk around the Perito Moreno glacier today, it's one of the few in the world that is expanding, which you can see in the form of massive shards breaking off as it grows accompanied by what sounds like bombs going off inside the glacier.

The first thing I learned is that a road being classed as a state highway in NZ is no guarentee of a smooth or even a paved surface. The second thing I learned is that my campervan has no traction control or ABS. The third thing I learned is that fitting a massive water tank, a fridge and all the electrical setup in the very back of a Toyota Estima makes it very tail happy on gravel and other loose surfaces. Combine all this with the fact that the car gives a panicked beep when it detects that it's going sideways and you have a fantasic rallycross game. I genuinely don't think I've laughed or smiled while driving a vehichle as much as I did today, although the roads down some of the gorges did make me shit myself. Regardless I lived to tell the tale and to find a tiny little out of the way campground (again deserted) which had an awesome natural amphitheate about an hours hike upriver. This place has hot showers but I still might try the river first tomorrow, something about a cold water swim in nature really sets you up well for the day. After that I'll be back on the rally circuit for a while as I head West towards The Surf Highway and hopefully some sunshine."

Taranaki on the way which looks like a slightly more rugged version of Mt. Fuji. Once I got to the coast I found the tallest thing I could to climb (monkey brain) and took in the view. After a surpringly steep clamber up Mount Moturoa I jumped back in the van and headed down the coast to grab some lunch at a vineyard on the ocean (great view and great seafood) and then continued down the Surf Highway to Ōpunake where I was able to enjoy some rare sunshine with a beer before the sun went down.

After a quick stop for supplies and to do some laundry in Palmerston North I made it to Holdsworth Lodge at the foot of the park and got set up. As I'd made the trip in such good time and the sun was shining I decided to go on one of the longer hikes that start from the lodge. Unfortunately the peaks in the park are pretty much perpetually wreathed in cloud so I didn't stay dry for long and after a couple hours the higher ground became a bog so I bravely turned around in favour of a dip in the river, fajitas and some Pinot Grigio from the vineyard I visted the day before.",

Later that day I crossed Oriental Bay and headed for the Wainuiomata Coast. I clearly didn't learn my lesson about unpredictable weather and hiking because I got caught out and thoroughly drenched in a storm halfway through a 3 hour hike. Thankfully the place I was staying had hot showers, and again was completely deserted, it's like I'm the only one who finds any of these places, kind of strange but no complaints.",

The only road to the lake is about 3 hours and only about 10% of it is paved, as such that means hardly anyone makes the journey and as a result there wasd only one other car in sight when I bounced and slid my way down to the lakeside. As you can see below the weather and the water were perfect, it even had a little island to swim out to (once the black swans were ousted). The occupants of the other car turned out to be a young Aussie bloke and his two little lads who were really good craic and apparently very adept at fishing. So after I'd built a fire with some of the driftwood around the shore we had fresh trout and a few beers to round out a pretty perfect road trip day. I kicked off the next day with a sunset swim out to Fanning Island (formally Black Swan Isle) and then hit the road heading for the Bay of Plenty.",

It's definitely a contender for the most scenic road so far, a winding gravel path bordered all the way North by the Hauraki Gulf glistening in the sunshine. The only downside were the multitude of caravans slowing down proceedings, but they were happy enough to let you pass when the road would allow. Arriving at the beach in Port Jackson it's clearly a popular spot to spend the festive season and probably the busiest place I've stayed so far, I got in a hike and a swim before the sun disappeared and the heavens opened for a couple of hours, just like Christmas back home!",

On the day itself we took a ferry to Waiheke Island and had a picnic on the beach once the sun came out. It turns out NZ doesn't sell alcohol on Xmas Day unless you buy a meal (which felt reminiscent of covid) so we then went to a beach bar and had one seafood platter and some chips between us, which allowed us to buy a few pitchers of beer, some champagne and about 15 teapots full of cocktails, #kiwiMaths.

The flight itself was on a little ~10 seater single prop aircraft with 2 rows of seats all facing towards the back of the plane. The views on the way up of the coast and the ocean were amazing but the views of the glaciers and the Southern Alps once we broker through the clouds were even better. Because we were going to 16,500ft (amazingly, roughly the same height as we were when we drove across the desert in Bolivia) we had to strap on oxygen masks for the last few minutes before the doors opened. Because your first jump is tandem, there's not a whole lot you have to do for the jump itself, just shuffle towards the door and wait for the guy your strapped to to throw himself out.

About 3 seconds after you leave the aircraft you hit terminal velocity (~120mph) which means from 16,500ft you freefall for about a minute before you pull the cord. That feeling of freefalling is so unique and exhilarating that I still get the feeling of jelly legs just writing about it now a few days later. Once you pull the cord and adjust yourself your tandem instructor will give you control of the chute for a while which is an amazingly free feeling, akin to skiing in really deep powder where you can't feel the bottom, I can absolutely see the appeal and how people get hooked on the combo of adreline rush in the freefall combined with floating on air after, would definitely recommend and would definitely do again!"

    "description": "A few hours after we had done our jump the clouds rolled in (and stopped the rest of the jumps that day), I took that as a good signal to head inland away from the damn sandflies and towards better weather. The first day I got as far as an old gold mining town called Reefton where I spent the night by a quick little river with more Kea inhabitants than humans. The next morning I chased away the last ramining kea who was nibbling my windscreen wipers and set off for the East coast where the sunshine was, ending up in a lovely little place called White's Bay, a seculded shallow bay with a sandy beach surrounding it and plenty of scenic hikes to stretch the legs after a long time sat in the drivers seat.",

    "description": "The plan for the next few days was to jaunt about Nelson & the Abel Tasman national park, swimming, kayaking and sunbathing. Unfortunately the weather had other plans, calling for 1 nice day followed by a few days of rain. As such I decided to skip over Nelson and head straight up the coast to the most Northerly point on the South Island, aptly named Cape Farewell to enjoy the sun and scenery before the rain came. What I didn't plan on was everyone else on the South Island doing the same thing and as a result every campsite, scenic stopping point or patch of grass in someone's garden being booked out. Thankfully I found a very nice lady from Birmingham called Nicky who ran a campsite and carved me out a patch of ground to park the van for the night, legend.",
