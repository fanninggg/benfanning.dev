What I didn't expect was for the hike to be a 5 hour slog through the jungle and for it to be 31°, I also took the smart decision to take a “shortcut” based on a comment left on a message board, which took me off the path and down a steep narrow gulley I affectionately named Spider Alley, only for the path to become a river thanks to all the rain over the past few days. That of course meant I had to hike back up The Alley, so lesson learned there. \n To be honest it was worth it in the end for the views, the waterfalls and the completely deserted beach surrounded by two rivers as they reached the sea. So if you're ever on Ilha Grande I'd recommend the Dois Rios hike, but maybe wear something other than white trainers unless you want them painted brown. After hiking the 12km back to Abrãao, I rewarded myself with a massive steak on the beach at a restaurant as inventively named as the island itself: Steak & Beach."
