What I didn't expect was for the hike to be a 5 hour slog through the jungle and for it to be 31°, I also took the smart decision to take a “shortcut” based on a comment left on a message board, which took me off the path and down a steep narrow gulley I affectionately named Spider Alley, only for the path to become a river thanks to all the rain over the past few days. That of course meant I had to hike back up The Alley, so lesson learned there. \n To be honest it was worth it in the end for the views, the waterfalls and the completely deserted beach surrounded by two rivers as they reached the sea. So if you're ever on Ilha Grande I'd recommend the Dois Rios hike, but maybe wear something other than white trainers unless you want them painted brown. After hiking the 12km back to Abrãao, I rewarded myself with a massive steak on the beach at a restaurant as inventively named as the island itself: Steak & Beach."

The town is essentially a Swiss mountain village that has been dropped onto the Northern tip of Patagonia complete with chocolate shops, fondue restaurants and ski lifts. The weather here is pretty unpredictable and so is the scenery. The area around town seems to have parts of Nevada, Utah, California, Northern Scotland, New Zeland and of course Switzerland all stitched together. Continued below...",

    "additionalContent": "Yesterday 4 of us rented a car for the equiliviant of £6 each (with petrol) and did a 12 hour round trip through the seven lakes to San Martin which was an amazing drive with it's own rally special stage to get to some of the lakes. Once we got to San Martin the clouds parted for a while so we had time to do a little hike on the cliffs surrounding the town/lake and then we found a lovely little restaurant for some fresh smoked lake trout sorrentinos. I'm currently writing this on a 6 hour bus through the Andes to Puerto Montt in Chile so I can fly further south into the heart of Patagonia to hike some pointy mountains (and yes it's the most beautiful bus ride I've ever taken)."
