Photos can be found down below, I likely won't upload every day while other days I might pop some bonus text content under the photos. Those expecting beautiful prose turn back now.",

Also destroyed the competition at karaoke, although there is no photo or video proof so you'll just have to trust me. 10 points to anyone who can guess the flag.",
